On the daily chart, the downward trend continues. After losing momentum from the level of 1.313 USD, GBPUSD is still on a decline. Additionally, market conditions seem unfavorable and with the tightening of Fed policies, GU has depreciated.\n\nThe next target for further decline can be seen at 1.2000 level, which is a strong psychological barrier."]]}
